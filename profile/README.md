# How to make a KiCad Repo

## 1.

Create a repository for EACH PCB that is made. Make it private and use the KiCad Template Repo

##2.

open the repo, go to settings and add 'maintain' access for the 'Electricals' team.

Naming scheme: EV[year]_[name-of-PCB]_PCB eg. EV24_VCU_PCB

## 3.

clone the repo to your device.

## 4.

Make a development branch to do all your work in. (From the desktop app, select 'new branch' and call it development. Publish this branch)

## 5.

Create a KiCad Project with the same name as the repo inside this new repo.

To release the PCB create a pull request and merge to the main branch. (not implamented yet)
